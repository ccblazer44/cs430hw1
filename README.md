PPM Image Format Converter by Chris Blazer

Use "make" to implement the makefile, which compiles the program using gcc.

Usage is just how the project specified; "ppmrw 3 input.ppm output.ppm".  Replace 3 with a 6 to change target format.

Includes 2 test ppm images for your use, one in each format- ppm3.ppm and ppm6.ppm.

Program will create the output file if it does not exist.

Sorry for the long some what spaghetti-ish code, I was a bit out of practice from the summer and have spent a lot of time getting it fully functional.  I promise the next project will look nicer.
